## What is this?
Igdb.com client i made for some lulz and getting experience with reactive coding. It's basically just working with igdb api and parsing it to fancy UI.

## Do i need something to use it?
Yep, you need API key because i don't provide it.

## What is min. reqs?
Android 5.0(api 21)

## Problems
* [] fix that annoying bug with blocking api key getting(not critical but slowing down app)

## Special thanks
* JetBrains for awesome IDE
* RMS for my favourite editor - EMACS
* My friend Vlad for awesome icon ;)
